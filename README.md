# ML-to-predict-Exercise-Performance

training a neural network to predict exercise performance based on:
  1. absolute sleep duration
  2. sleep efficiency (time asleep / time in bed)
  3. duration REM-Sleep
  4. duration Deep-Sleep
  5. night-time HRV
  6. past exercise performance

Exercise Performance is measured by predicted 1RM (1 rep max) based on (weight and repititions)
